## Apollo Workbench VSCode 2.0

- Federation 2 Alpha support
- Create a new Apollo Studio graph from a workbench design
- Export project capabilities for any design

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 1.1

- Support multiple workbench design files with errors and context
- Workbench file upgrades for feature work (backwards compatible)
- Mocks engine overhaul
  - Upgrade to Apollo Server 3.0
  - Use Apollo Sandbox as default with auto-open url
    - Introduce setting `apollo-workbench.openSandboxOnStartMocks` to disable auto-open url
  - Upgrade to latest @apollo/gateway/federation/query-plan packages
  - UI feedback when starting up multiple mocked subgraphs (tested with 25 subgraphs)
- Local files are now synced into Workbench. This means if you delete a workbench file in VS Code, then switch back to the workbench extension, the design file will no longer exist
  - This is how you delete a workbench file locally 
- Filtered output to have a better structure

### Bug Fixes

- Mocks don't work with schemas that define Apollo Federation Spec items (i.e. `Query._service`)
- Wrong workbench file could be loaded due to different design subgraph schema being open while local tree refresh happens
- Type completion for arrays printed incorrectly
- Various 

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 1.0 - INITIAL RELEASE

----

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.39

- Added support for fowarding headers from Gateway to downstream services while mocked
  - Introduced `apollo-workbench.headersToForwardFromGateway` which takes an array of string values which will be used to copy header values from the Gateway's context to the requests sent to downstream services
  - This is meant to support various scenarios where downstream services require certain header values to be present

### Bug Fixes

- When starting up mocks and using a remote URL that can't be found, display the output results in VSCode Output Panel

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.36

- Introduced Service/Schema settings
  - Can view settings as a json file and save
    - Setting visualized from the workbench file
    - Introduced `autoUpdateSchemaFromUrl` to `WorkbenchSchema`
  - Context menu (right click) functionality points at workbench file directly
- New mocking capabilities along with remote development options
  - Update schema from a given url
    - If Apollo Federation Spec is not supported (meaning `query { _service { sdl } }` fails), an introspection query will be used
  - Conditionally mock any service/schema defined in workbench
  - Ability to auto-update a given service/schema with mocks running
    - You may want to use this if are developing a service that must be started to provide it's schema (like Ruby or Kotlin). This would allow you to see changes as you develop that service in your mocked gateway running locally along with any composition errors in the problems panel
  - Added `apollo-workbench.tlsRejectUnauthorized` to the available settings to support gateway sending requests to remote urls where an cert is used that can't be verified. This allows you to specifically toggle `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` as needed; by default `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`
- Changed menu options and ordering for Current Workbench Services
- Changed name of TreeView from "Current Workbench Schemas" to "Current Workbench Services"

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.8

- Upgrade Visual Indicator for loading workbench files

### Bugs

- Usage of `yield` to unblock vscode extension ui thread from `composeAndValidate` :tada:

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.7

- Local development mocking toggle options implemented
  - Needs docs
  - Can have portions of graph point at specific urls, others mocked
    - Currently no auth/header options available
- Provide visual indicators of what is going on during composition and loading of workbench file (large schemas can take a second to load)

### Known bugs

- `composeAndValidate` from `@apollo/federation` is blocking the vscode extension ui thread :bug:

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.6

- Support composite keys in intellisense :tada:

### Bugs

- CSDL file not refreshing properly. Moved to not use openTextDocument as VS Code pulls from a cache instead of consitently calling the `FileProvier.readFile`

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.5

- Added new icons
- Pretty print operations

### Bugs

- Intellisense takes along time to load with large generated csdl
  - Excessive calls to `getText` in csdlParser removed

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.3

### Improvements:

- General stability across basic functions:
  - Getting started
    - Streamlined creating new folder
    - Enter API key has feedback
  - Creating a workbench file from multiple sources
    - New (blank)
    - From Apollo Studio Graph
    - From Example Graph
  - Rename workbench files
  - Composition now updates CSDL visible if error
  - Studio graphs loading
    - Enable loading operations when clicking on any graph
    - Enable setting to change days for traces fetched from Apollo Studio
  - Studio Operations Viewing
    - Open edit-only view of graphql operations from Studio when clicking on a row in graph loaded operations

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.2

- Open any fodler

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.1

- Intellisense for writing queries

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.2.0

### Potential Breaking Changes

Extension now utilizes a file provider and workbench schema/query/queryplan files are no longer created in a `.workbench` folder. Any changes to a local schema file (that have not been synced to the workbench file) in previous extension versions will not update the workbench file. It is recommended to delete any `.workbench` files

### Improvements:

- Moved from chokidar to using a VSCode file provider
- Added Getting Started section to local schema files tree, auto-preview markdown files for getting started
- Mocks are no longer automatically started as they could linger in the background of a vscode window that had the extension opened at one point. Start/Stop commands have been introduced to toggle mocking

### Known Bugs:

- Intellisense does not currently recognize composite keys or multiple keys
- Composition Errors sometimes don't point at the correct location in the document
- Intellisense type completion is currently missing from writing operations, to be added back in shortly
- ## Currently doesn't support opening workbench in a complex folder (i.e. a node project with a node_modules folder)

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.1.3

### Improvements:

- Cache csdl parsing - was taking a long time to load for large schemas

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.1.2

### Improvements:

- Add graphql-parser functions for reading available type/extension/scalar/enum/interface definitions when developing
- Added better location/type mapping

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.1.1

### Improvements:

- Hide `.workbench` folder and associated files into background
- Introduce _rename_ schema functionality
- Introduce _duplicate_ workbench file functionlity
- Simplify context/menu items
  - Removed all buttons from schema/operaitons for currently loaded workbench (with the exception of opening query plan)
  - Centralized options to right click context items
  - Moved destructive actions to a new group to add line separtation
- [MVP] - Added Completion Item provider for available type extensions from CSDL :tada:
  - Doesn't show extension options for what is defined in open service/schema file
    - Future improvement could be to provide these as options that just move the cursor to the given position
  - [BUG] Currently doesn't support composite keys
- [MVP] - Added preloaded workbench example file

## Apollo Workbench VSCode 0.1.0

  - ApolloGateway extension where `loadServiceDefinitions` points at the workbench file to compose
  - Composition errors are logged to vscode.Diagnostics in Problems panel
  - Query plan generation using Rust wasm can be viewed for any opertion with a composed graph
