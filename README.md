# Apollo Workbench for VS Code

Workbench is a tool built by the Apollo Solutions Team to help design schemas using Apollo Federation and work with the composed results. This need was driven by working countless number of migrations from an existing GraphQL infrastructure (monolith or schema stitched) to an [Apollo Federated architecture](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

Head over to the [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v2/workbench/overview/) to learn how you can use this tool.

## Required Installations

**rover** - This extension requires the GraphOS CLI `rover` to be installed. Most of the functionality in the extension is based on various `rover` commands (like `rover supergraph compose`). There are [simple installation instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started) for various platforms to install `rover`.
